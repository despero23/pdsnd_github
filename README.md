US Bikeshare Study

## Description

Welcome to the US Bikeshare Data Analysis project! 

This Python-based application allows users to explore and analyze bikeshare data from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. By leveraging the power of Pandas and Matplotlib, the project provides insightful statistics and visualizations on bikeshare usage patterns.

### Key Features:

* City Selection: Choose from Chicago, New York City, or Washington to analyze bikeshare data.
* Flexible Filtering: Filter data by month and day to focus on specific time periods.
* Comprehensive Statistics: Discover the most frequent times of travel, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics.
* Interactive Visualizations: View histograms and bar charts that illustrate the distribution of trips, start hours, station usage, and user types.

## Files used
* bikeshare.py - main python script
* Data base files:
    * chicago.csv
    * new_york_city.csv
    * washington.csv
    > Note: Data base files are excluded from the repository via the .gitignore file.
